Monte Carlo simulation of neutron instrument.

This is the foundation of the MCViNE.

Monte Carlo instrument simulation involvs simulation of a 
sequance of neutron components.
mcni defines an instrument as a sequence of neutron components,
and the positions and orientations of those components are
kept in a geometer.
A simulator runs neutrons through this sequence.

All Monte Carlo neutron components must be derived from
AbstractComponent.

mcni package takes care of instrument level. mccomponents
package will take care of simulatoin of neutron components.

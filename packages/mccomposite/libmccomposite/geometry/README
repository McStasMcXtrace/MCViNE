geometry c++ library. it is following the ideas of pyre.geometry.
It is quite generic, although it currently depends on mcni. 
All mcni dependencies are in the header files in the top level 
directory. Please grep for mcni and take a look.
If we want to make it independent of mcni, we just need to 
implement those classes:

 - Position
 - Direction
 - Vector
 - RotationMatrix

This template helps developers to extend mccomponents to introduce new neutron
scattering kernels.

Following is a tutorial. The result of this tutorial is saved in directory ../neutron_printer3

1. copy this directory to a new directory dedicated for your new project,
   say neutron_printer3
1. edit wrap.cc to add definition of the kernel class, and its binding code.
1. rename kernelbpmodule.cc to neutron_printer3bpmodule.cc
  and replace "xxxMODULExxx" in that file to the module name you want.
  In this example, we use "neutron_printer3bp"
1. rename kernel.py to neutron_printer3.py and edit it to read:
  >>> import mccomponents
  >>> from neutron_printer3bp import NeutronPrinter as cKernel
  The 1st line is necessary because we need to import bindings of base classes of mccoponents.
  The 2nd line import the boost python binding of the new c++ kernel and name
  it "cKernel". You can rename it to whatever you want. 
1. edit Make.mm
  First few lines:
  PROJECT = 
  MODULE = neutron_printer3bp
  PACKAGE = neutron_printer3bpmodule

  Last few lines:
  EXPORT_PYTHON_MODULES = \
	neutron_printer3.py \

  export:: export-python-modules 
1. run mm

= Software Organization =

Installed MCViNE software has following directory structure:

 * bin: simulation applications
 * lib: c++ shared library 
 * python: python modules
 * include: c++ header files

The main user interface of MCViNE is provided through python bindings in "python" directory.
It contains the following packages:

 * mcni: the base of mcvine. It provides fundamental data structures like Neutron, Component, and Instrument
 * mccomposite: introduce geometrical shapes to component simulation
 * mccomponents: introduce homogeneous scatterer and scattering kernels. provide tools to simulate sample assembly and detector system with hierarchy
 * legacycomponents: simulation components derived from legacy MC neutron instrument simulation codes
   - mcstas2: binding of McStas components

Introduction
==============

MCViNE is a Monte Carlo simulation framework useful for simulating neutron experiments. 

1. MCViNE is a framework to construct simulated neutron instruments, and manage the flow of neutrons through them from moderator to detector.
2. It also provides a structure for assembling a sample assembly (including sample and also the sample environment, eg. sample holder). This structure is capable of handling arbitrary complex geometeric shapes of neutron scatterer, and arbitrary complex physics of neutron scattering


Example usages
--------------

Due to the flexibility of the framework, it 

1. can simulate complex sample with scattering of various origins (phonon scattering and magnetic scattering, etc)
2. can simulate accurately a real, complex detector system such as that of the ARCS instrument at SNS

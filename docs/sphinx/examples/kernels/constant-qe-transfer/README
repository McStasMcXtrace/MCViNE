This example is for constant QE transfer scattering kernel.

To run:

 $ ./run.sh

Instrument:

 MonochromaticSource -> Al sample with constant QE transfer kernel -> I(Q,E) monitor

Result:
 
 Scattered neutrons has the exact momentum transfer (scalar) and energy transfer
 specified in kernel:
   Q = 3 AA-1
   E = 30 meV


Output:

  $ PlotHist.py out/iqe.h5

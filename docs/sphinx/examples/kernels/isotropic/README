This example is for elastic isotropic scattering kernel.

To run:

 $ ./run.sh

Instrument:

 MonochromaticSource -> Al sample with isotropic kernel -> PSD 4pi monitor

Result:
 
 Scattered neutrons are istropic and have the exact same energy as the incident neutrons.

Output:

  $ PlotHist.py out/psd4pi.h5

This example is for constant-energy transfer scattering kernel.

To run:

 $ ./run.sh

Instrument:

 MonochromaticSource -> Al sample with constant energy transfer kernel -> I(Q,E) monitor

Result:
 
 Incident neutrons are all in z direction and have the same energy Ei=100meV.
 The energy transfer is constant: E=10meV.
 Scattered neutrons are istropic and have the exact same energy 
   Ef = Ei - E = 100.-10. = 90. meV
 The I(Q,E) plot shows one line corresponding to E=10meV.

Output:

  $ PlotHist.py out/iqe.h5

To build, we need jsmath

Go to jsmath site, download both jsmath 3.6 and the image font zip files.
Expand both. The jsmath main zip file expands to

root 
 + easy
 + extensions
 + plugins
 ...


The font zip file expands to

root
 + fonts

Just copy or move the fonts subdir into the main jsmath directory


Now set env var JSMATH_DIR to the directory where jsmath was expanded.

You are ready to run mm.

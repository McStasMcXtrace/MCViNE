This simulation send neutrons saved from another simulation
(simulation of ARCS instrument and a neutron recorder was
placed just in front of the sample position)
to  the sample, and record scattered neutrons.

Requirements:

 - neutrons. We need a symbolic link "ARCS_neutrons_at_sample"
   pointing to the neutron directory created in the last simulation
 - phonon dispersion directory 'phonon-dispersion".

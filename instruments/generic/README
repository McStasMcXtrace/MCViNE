Attention
!!!!!!!!!
Actually these scripts here are obsolete.
We don't need generic instruments. 
Just use mcvine-create-instrument-simulation-application to
create instruments and run them.

We should migrate the examples in this directory somewhere else,
and then remove this directory.


Obsolete
!!!!!!!!
Generic instrument simulation scripts. 
These scripts can be used to quickly run simulations,
and be used for quick tests.

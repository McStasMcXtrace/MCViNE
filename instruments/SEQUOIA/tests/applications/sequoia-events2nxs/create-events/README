The simulation here sends neutrons to sequoia detector system.

The neutrons were simulated from an artificial sample 
that scatters only to one particular angle (on a cone).
The neutrons were saved in the file "scattered-neutrons-example".
That simulation was done with incident energy 700meV.
The sample was a "resolution sample", which only scatters neutrons
to Q = 10 angstrom**-1 and E = 100 meV.

The detector system is specified by SEQUOIA.xml. 

To run this simulation, run command "run".

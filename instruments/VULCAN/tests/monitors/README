This test compares NDMonitor and PSD_TEW_monitor for a very simple system:

[Source] -> [Monitor]

For energy range of Source_simple: [30, 170] meV and distance from source to monitor
20 meters, TOF should be in the range: [3.5, 8.34] ms.

Notations:
ndmonitor   -> NDMonitor
psdmonitor  -> PSD_TEW_monitor

Configurations:
